# Dave's JavaScript Projects

### These are some small projects I made using JavaScript:

-[The Calculator](https://github.com/DaveBoss510/JavaScript-Projects/tree/main/Calculator)<br>

A basic 4 function calculator. Users can add, subtract, multiply, and divide 
on a styled web version of a calculator.

-[Pizza Menu](https://github.com/DaveBoss510/JavaScript-Projects/tree/main/Pizza_Project)<br>

This project is a simple restaurants pizza menu. It has multiple options of toppings and 
pizza sizes. It takes the user's input information and calculates a price for the order.<br><br>
-[Tic-Tac-Toe Game](https://github.com/DaveBoss510/JavaScript-Projects/tree/main/TicTacToe)<br>

The classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe. It randomly selects which player will go first, the computer or 
the user, and it is programed to play against the user-making it a one-player game. There are 
sound effects throughout the game for when the user makes a move, or when there is a win, lose or
draw outcome.
