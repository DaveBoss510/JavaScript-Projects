    <p>I'm learning SQL and was trying to make a very large table which I could use for optimization tests. Something generic with random values. I created a little Java program to do just that, and was able to put out a text file with 100,000 lines, each line being an SQL INSERT statement for a new random record. However, with anything much bigger than 100,000 lines, I had problems either opening/using the text file in any text editor, or copying/pasting the text to the windows clipboard and then into SQL Developer so I could execute it as a script.

        I'm probably overlooking something really obvious, or doing something really stupid. There has got to be a better way to do this, but I couldn't find anything through Google or Stackoverflow or Superuser.</p>
